# Input Sample Notes

This repository does not redistribute original malware input samples or malware-derived executable payloads.

Use `input_sha256.csv` to verify sample integrity in your own isolated lab environment.

If you already have legal access to the sample set, place your files locally under your own `input/` directory and verify hashes before running the workflow.
